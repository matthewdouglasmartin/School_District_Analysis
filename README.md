# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

A local school board has requested the compilation of school performance within its school district.  The performance of the school district by math and reading scores was categorized by school, math and reading scores by grade, school size, school spending and school type.  Initially analysis was performed on a data set provided by the school district, but this original data set had incorrect scores for the 9th grade students from Thomas High School.  An updated analysis that does not include the performance of 9th graders from Thomas High School was requested by the school district.  Once updated and with further analysis, the below conclusions regarding the comparison of these two school district performance summaries were drawn. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

* How is the district summary affected?
  *  
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    * Math and reading scores by grade
    * Scores by school spending
    * Scores by school size
    * Scores by school type

## Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
